 Combinatorics library for the Processings

 This library provides an easy way to generate combinations, variations and 
 permutations from a given set of values.

 Current release is now compatible with JavaScript mode in Processing 2.0

 What?

 Combinatorics library provides iterators for these combinatorical sets:
    
 – Combinations
 – CombinationSets
 – Variations
 – VariationSets
 – Permutations
    
 The iterators provide arrays of indices (addresses) into an imaginary 
 array of a given length at each step. These adresses can then be used 
 on any kind of real array. Example needed, so ..
    
 Say you have a String array:
 
 { "A", "B", "C" }
 
 ... and you'd like to find all possible combinations at any length.
 A CombinationSet would return these indice arrays:
 
 []                       empty (0 elements)
 [0], [1], [2]            combinations of 1 element
 [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]   combinations of 2 elements
 [0, 1, 2]                combinations of 3 elements
 
 Using these indices to read from your array would give you:
 
 (null)
 ["A"], ["B"], ["C"]
 ["A", "B"], ["A", "C"], ["B", "C"]
 ["A", "B", "C"]
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A quick class overview:
 
 Combination      unique combinations, no duplications, order is ignored
 CombinationSet   range of combinations at different lengths
 Variation        all possible variations, includes duplication, order matters
 VariationSet     range of variations at different lengths
 Permutation      all possible ways to order the elements, no duplications
